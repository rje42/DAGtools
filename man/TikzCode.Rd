\arguments{
\item{x}{adjacency matrix from MCMC summary}

\item{file}{file to output code (defaults to stout)}

\item{z}{optionally, a matrix of z-scores}

\item{n_pos}{optional matrix of node positions (requires Rgraphviz if not specified)}

\item{ud_thresh}{threshold for drawing edges as undirected}

\item{cutoff}{threshold for including edges}

\item{bend}{edge angles}

\item{func}{vectorized function to transform probabilities}

\item{bend_double}{bend automatically if arrows in two different directions?}

\item{rev}{logical - should thickness and density plotting be reversed?}

\item{...}{other arguments}
}
\description{
Generate Tikz Code for Plot
}
\details{
If more than \code{ud_thresh} of the edges present
are in a particular direction, then the two directions are drawn
separately, otherwise an undirected edge is drawn.  Edges present
in less than \code{cutoff} sampled graphs are ignored entirely. \code{func}
is a transformation that can be applied to the probability (e.g.
squaring it to reduce the visual impact of weak edges).  This must
take a matrix and return a matrix of the transformed values.

If \code{z} is specified, then the function will plot the thickness
of the line to be related to this quantity.
If \code{rev = TRUE} then the thickness of the line is related to the
size of the effect, and the density of colour to the proportion of
samples containing that effect.
